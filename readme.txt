✅ Java Fundamentals — Daily Progress Summary
📌 Core Objective

Rebuild and validate Java fundamentals through hands-on problem solving, covering syntax, control flow, and program structure.

🧱 Topics Successfully Solved
1. Java Program Structure

Wrote and executed a valid Java program using:

public class

public static void main(String[] args)

Demonstrated correct compilation and execution flow.

2. Console Output

Used System.out.println() effectively.

Produced formatted, readable console output.

3. Variables & Data Types

Declared and used:

String

int

boolean

Applied variable values dynamically in output statements.

Reinforced Java’s strong static typing.

4. Operators

Performed and printed results of:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Modulo

Understood integer division behavior.

5. Conditional Logic

Implemented decision-making using:

if

Logical comparisons (>, <, ==)

Practiced handling mutually exclusive conditions.

6. Switch Statements

Used switch with char input.

Correctly mapped cases to outputs.

Applied break to prevent fall-through.

7. Loops

Used for loops to:

Print sequential numbers

Apply conditional logic inside loops

Gained awareness of loop boundaries and off-by-one logic.

8. Methods

Created reusable methods:

add

subtract

multiply

Returned values properly.

Called methods from main.

9. Arrays (Completed After Review)

Created an integer array.

Used loops to compute:

Sum

Average

Maximum

Minimum

Practiced array traversal and state tracking.

🧠 Key Concepts Reinforced

Flow of execution in Java

Difference between syntax correctness and logical correctness

Importance of structure (if–else, loop bounds)

Writing readable, maintainable code

🎯 Overall Assessment

You successfully covered Java Fundamentals Problems 1–8, demonstrating:

Solid baseline Java syntax

Correct procedural logic

Readiness to move into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
